# Examination-on-Chemical-Compositions-of-Glass
The Glass.csv dataset (posted on Brightspace) examines the chemical compositions of 15th-17th century
archaeological glass vessels excavated in Antwerp. The data record the concentrations of 13 elements,
determined by x-ray methods, in 180 glass vessels. The data consist of measurements on four different types
of glass (detailed in the Group variable in the data set).
